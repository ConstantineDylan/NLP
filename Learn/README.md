In this notebook, we will not be working with spaCy in code, rather in concept. This entire JupyterBook is designed around approaching spaCy top-down. By this I mean approaching the things that spaCy does and can do and then exploring how to implement that in code. I think this is necessary so that as you explore the smaller components of spaCy, such as the Lemmatizer, you will understand how it fits into the larger architecture of the spaCy frameworks.
